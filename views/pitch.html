				<h3>Pitch</h3>
				<p class = "bullet">This application will help those who have no real physical playing cards be able to play cards with each other. Often when people are travelling or in groups they either forgot or did not plan to bring cards with them. It is difficult to anticipate in advance when you will forget to bring cards. It is often more likely that each person has a smartphone or a tablet on them. People will use this app because it will provide them with a digital set of cards that can be brought up anywhere. </p>
				<h3>Description</h3>
				<p class = "bullet">The goal of the app is to have all the flexibility of having real playing cards, instead of having a strict framework in which the players have to operate in. It will be lightweight, easy to use and will support any number of players. When completed it should be able to support many types of card games, with the option to add any card game desired. It will meet the need because most people already have a smartphone on them all the time and the website will be easily accessible and the game quick to set up. </p>

				<h3>Interface</h3>

				<li class = "bullet">After the users click "Play!" on the top right corner, they can either create their own games or join other user's game. The name of the game and the spaces left are shown for the games that are available.</li>
				<img src="pitchImages/join.png" height="250" width="500" align="middle">
				<br><br><br><br>
				<li class = "bullet">After the user clicks create game or join game, a deck of cards shows up on the table. The group and upgroup buttons allow players to choose between moving the entire deck or a single card.</li>

				<img src="pitchImages/shuffle.png" height="250" width="500" align="middle">
				<br><br><br><br>
				<li class = "bullet">The user is easily able to deal out the cards by inputing the number of players (now for testing purposes, will be eiminated in the future) and the number of cards that each player will recieve. The rest of the cards that are not dealed will just be on the table. After the player clicks deal, players are able to "pick up" and "put down" their cards by simply sliding up/down on the screen in the white area. Each user can see their own hand of cards in the white area. (Please ignore the five buttons, e.g., table, player1, ..., on top, they are for testing purposes)</li>
