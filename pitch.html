				<h3>Pitch</h3>
				<p class = "bullet">This application will help those who have no real physical playing cards be able to play cards with each other. Often when people are travelling or in groups they either forgot or did not plan to bring cards with them. It is difficult to anticipate in advance when you will forget to bring cards. It is often more likely that each person has a smartphone or a tablet on them. People will use this app because it will provide them with a digital set of cards that can be brought up anywhere. </p>
				<h3>Description</h3>
				<p class = "bullet">The goal of the app is to have all the flexibility of having real playing cards, instead of having a strict framework in which the players have to operate in. It will be lightweight, easy to use and will support any number of players. When completed it should be able to support many types of card games, with the option to add any card game desired. It will meet the need because most people already have a smartphone on them all the time and the website will be easily accessible and quick to set up. </p>
